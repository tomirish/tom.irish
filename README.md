Personal website and resume for Tom Irish — a single-page design that simulates multiple sections, with automated markdown-to-HTML conversion and PDF generation.

Edit `resume.md`, push to GitHub, and everything updates automatically.

## How It Works

```
resume.md edited and pushed to main
       ↓
GitHub Actions triggers
       ↓
validate_resume.py    — checks format and required sections
       ↓
convert_resume.py     — updates index.html from resume.md
       ↓
generate_pdf_browser.py — generates resume.pdf via headless Chromium
       ↓
Files synced to public/
       ↓
Cloudflare deploys from public/ → https://tom.irish
```

## Files

| File | Purpose | Edit? |
|------|---------|-------|
| `resume.md` | Resume content source | ✅ Yes |
| `index.html` | Website HTML | ❌ Auto-generated |
| `resume.pdf` | PDF resume | ❌ Auto-generated |
| `public/` | Production-ready files | ❌ Auto-generated |
| `assets/` | CSS, images, icons | ✅ Yes — to change styling |
| `scripts/` | Build automation | 🔧 Only if changing the pipeline |
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | GitHub Actions config | 🔧 Only if changing automation |

---

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Validate resume format
python3 scripts/validate_resume.py

# Dry-run conversion (no files written)
python3 scripts/convert_resume.py --dry-run

# Full conversion
python3 scripts/convert_resume.py

# Generate PDF
python3 scripts/generate_pdf_browser.py

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Preview site locally
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Resume didn't update after push

1. Check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/tomirish/tom.irish/actions) for build status
2. Review the logs for errors
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for Cloudflare to deploy
4. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

### Build failed

- **Missing required sections:** `resume.md` must have Professional Summary, Work Experience, Skills, and Education
- **Incorrect format:** Job entries must follow `### Company - Job Title (Start - End)`
- **Dependency issues:** Check Actions logs for pip install errors

Run locally to debug: `python3 scripts/validate_resume.py`

### PDF is more than one page or content is cut off

Edit the named constants at the top of `scripts/generate_pdf_browser.py`:

```python
PDF_FORMAT        = 'Letter'
PDF_MARGIN_TOP    = '0.2in'
PDF_MARGIN_RIGHT  = '0.2in'
PDF_MARGIN_BOTTOM = '0.2in'
PDF_MARGIN_LEFT   = '0.2in'
PDF_SCALE         = 0.98   # < 1.0 shrinks content to fit more on one page
```

### "Push rejected" error

The auto-build commits generated files back to `main` — if it runs while you're working you'll need to pull first:

```bash
git pull origin main --no-rebase
git push origin main
```
